This repository completes 6 experiments of operating system, including using fork() to create child processes in different situations, building shared memory between parent and child process, using signal to build the communication between parent and child process, implementing a simple shell, completing a program to copy a file and using pthread to create multithreaded program.
From these experiments we could know several kinds of the linux system calls, how to distinguish the relationship between parent and child processes and what is multithreaded programming.
